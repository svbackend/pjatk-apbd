Small app which converts students from csv into xml/json data formats.

You can provide 3 arguments:

* CSV file path (default: ./data.csv)
* Output file path (default: ./result.xml)
* Data format (default: xml)

Error log saved (if possible) to ./log.txt or in case of error (e.g permission denied) logs would be printed to console
